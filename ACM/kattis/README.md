| Problem Title| CP4.beta| Hint | My Solution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Kattis - epigdanceoff](https://open.kattis.com/problems/epigdanceoff) | 2.2c, 2D Array, Easier | count number of CCs on 2D grid; simpler solution exists: count the number of blank columns plus one | [epigdanceoff.cpp](epigdanceoff.cppg) |
| [Kattis - flowshop](https://open.kattis.com/problems/flowshop) | 2.2c, 2D Array, Easier | interesting 2D array manipulation | [flowshop.cpp](flowshop.cpp) |
| [Kattis - imageprocessing](https://open.kattis.com/problems/imageprocessing) | 2.2c, 2D Array, Easier | interesting 2D array manipulation | [imageprocessing.cpp](imageprocessing.cpp) |
| [Kattis - nineknights](https://open.kattis.com/problems/nineknights) | 2.2c, 2D Array, Easier | 2D array checks; 8 directions | [nineknights.cpp](nineknights.cpp) |
| [Kattis - basicprogramming2](https://open.kattis.com/problems/basicprogramming2) | 2.2e, Sorting, Easier | a nice problem about basic sorting applications | [basicprogramming2](basicprogramming2.cpp) |
| [Kattis - height](https://open.kattis.com/problems/height) | 2.2e, Sorting, Easier | insertion sort simulation | [height.cpp](height.cpp) |
| [Kattis - mjehuric](https://open.kattis.com/problems/mjehuric) | 2.2e, Sorting, Easier | a direct simulation of a bubble sort algorithm | [mjehuric.cpp](mjehuric.cpp) |
| [Kattis - sidewayssorting](https://open.kattis.com/problems/sidewayssorting) | 2.2e, Sorting, Easier | stable_sort or sort multi-fields of columns of a 2D array; ignore case | [sidewayssorting.cpp](sidewayssorting.cpp) |
| [Kattis - evenup](https://open.kattis.com/problems/evenup) | 2.2i, Stack | use stack to solve this problem | [evenup.cpp](evenup.cpp) |
| [Kattis - pairingsocks](https://open.kattis.com/problems/pairingsocks) | 2.2i, Stack | simulation using two stacks; just do as asked | [pairingsocks.cpp](pairingsocks.cpp) |
| [Kattis - restaurant](https://open.kattis.com/problems/restaurant) | 2.2i, Stack | simulation with stack-based concept; drop plates at stack 2 (LIFO); use move 2->1 to reverse order; take from stack 1 (FIFO) | [restaurant.cpp](restaurant.cpp) |
| [Kattis - throwns](https://open.kattis.com/problems/throwns) | 2.2i, Stack | use stack of egg positions to help with the undo operation; be careful of corner cases involving modulo operation | [throwns.cpp](throwns.cpp) |
| [Kattis - coconut](https://open.kattis.com/problems/coconut) | 2.2j, List/Queue/Deque | maintain a circular linked list of hand symbols; variant of Josephus problem; other solution exists | [coconut.cpp](coconut.cpp) |
| [Kattis - integerlists](https://open.kattis.com/problems/integerlists) | 2.2j, List/Queue/Deque | use deque for fast deletion from front (normal) & back (reversed list); use stack to reverse the final list if it is reversed at the end | |
| [Kattis - joinstrings](https://open.kattis.com/problems/joinstrings) | 2.2j, List/Queue/Deque | all '+' operations must be O(1) | |
| [Kattis - teque](https://open.kattis.com/problems/teque) | 2.2j, List/Queue/Deque | all operations must be O(1) | |
